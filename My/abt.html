					<h3>Triyog High School (THS), a private English Medium School was founded in 1987, with a handful of students, by a small group of Nepalese women concerned with providing the girls of Nepal with quality education. The School is committed to a sound education based on all round development of ‘mind’, ‘body’ and ‘soul’ of its students. Thirty one years down the line, it has grown into one of the premier co-ed institutions in the country. In this present age where concerned parents are constantly seeking to provide their children with quality education that fosters creativity as well as builds a strong background in academia, Triyog aims to take up the role of a quality school in their midst.</p>
